# arc_tutorials
This repo contains packages used by ARC for teaching ROS

To get started, you will want to set up your development environment. Take a
look at the `docs` folder to get started.

After getting your development environment set up, you can work on the `snake_tutorial`
project, which will teach you the basics of developing with ROS. It will also
give you an open ended project to improve the very basic AI controller created
through following the tutorial.
