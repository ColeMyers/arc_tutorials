# arc_tutorials
This repo contains packages used by ARC for teaching ROS. A brief overview of the tutorials
can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9RCP4lizNM).

To get started, you will want to set up your development environment. Take a
look at the `docs` folder to begin that process. You'll use Docker, a lightweight
vitural machine, to run an Ubuntu container pre-installed with ROS and other tools
used in this tutorial series.

After getting your development environment set up, you can work on the `snake_tutorial`
project, which will teach you the basics of developing with ROS using Python. Through it,
you will develop a **very** basic AI capable of playing the [Snake game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9RCP4lizNM).
At the end, you'll find some additional resources to further your ROS education.
