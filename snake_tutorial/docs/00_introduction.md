# Snake Tutorial Introduction
This set of documents will walk you through the process of creating a simple,
snake-game controller. Before working through this tutorial, ensure you have gone through the process of [setting up your ARC development environment](../../docs/00_introduction.md).

By the end of this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of ROS and
how to use the development tools surrounding it.

## Setup
As mentioned, you should have already setup your ARC development environment.
Beyond that, just ensure your file structure matches the following:
```
catkin_ws <-- You should be here
│
└───src
    │
    └───arc_tutorials
       │
